                <p>The United States will deliver more military aid and return a diplomatic presence to Ukraine in a show of support as the war enters a new phase at the start of its third month.

                    The pledges, which came as Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin made a secretive trip to Kyiv, will seek to bolster faith in Ukraine’s defenses as Russia launches its new offensive in the country’s south and east.

                    Speaking after they met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and others in the country's capital, the American officials offered robust support for Kyiv's cause. Blinken said that "Russia is failing" to achieve its war aims, while Austin said that Washington wants "to see Russia weakened" militarily so it can't do things like invade its democratic neighbor in the future.

                    With the U.S. and its allies seemingly emboldened by Russia's struggles in the war, the West saw a further boost to the cause with the re-election of French President Emmanuel Macron. Zelenskyy congratulated Macron, calling the centrist leader “a true friend of Ukraine” after he held off the challenge of the far-right Marine Le Pen, who threatened to upend NATO and urged closer ties with the Kremlin.. <span id="dots1" class="dots">...</span><span id="more1" class="more">

                    Teen talent to national institution
                    Joaquin is the oldest player in La Liga and a national institution. He has provided more than two decades of entertainment on the pitch since making his debut for Betis, aged 19, in September 2000.

                    A traditional winger with wonderful ball skills, a mesmerising change of pace and wicked delivery into the box, it was immediately obvious he was a special talent.

                    He stayed with his boyhood club Betis for six seasons, winning the Copa del Rey in 2005 and becoming a regular in the Spain team.

                    The winger's consistent brilliance led to a move to Valencia for £20m in 2006. Another Copa del Rey triumph followed two years later, but he gradually became less important for Los Che and joined Malaga in 2011.

                        His spell on the south coast was unexpectedly successful, with Manuel Pellegrini leading an exciting team to a fourth-placed finish and a Champions League quarter-final. Joaquin then left Spain for the first time to spend a couple of seasons with Fiorentina, before making a romantic return to his boyhood club Betis in 2015.</span>

                <p>The Russian military said Monday it will open a corridor to allow civilians to evacuate from the steel plant harboring the last of Ukraine’s resistance in besieged Mariupol.

                    The Russian defense ministry said in a statement that starting from 2 p.m. Moscow time on Monday (7 a.m. E.T.) its forces will cease fire and withdraw “to a safe distance” to allow civilians, including women and children to safely exit from the Azovstal plant.

                    Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk contradicted Russia's claim, saying that a humanitarian corridor can only function if both sides agree to it.

                    "The corridor, announced unilaterally, does not provide security, and therefore, in fact, is not a humanitarian corridor," Vereshchuk said in a statement on Facebook. "So, I declare officially and publicly: unfortunately, there are no agreements on humanitarian corridors from Azovstal today."

                    The back-and-forth comes after Ukraine had accused Moscow of forcibly transferring Mariupol residents into Russia without providing them with an option to escape into Ukrainian-controlled territory. Kyiv authorities also blame Russia for blocking evacuation buses from getting into the city.

                    The Russian defense ministry also claimed, without evidence, that the civilians at Azovstal were being held by Ukrainian forces as a “human shield” and there were “no obstacles to the exit of civilians from Azovstal.”

                    An estimated 1,000 civilians are sheltering along with about 2,000 Ukrainian soldiers in the steelworks, a massive Soviet-era complex with a warren of underground facilities built to withstand airstrikes. <span id="dots2">...</span><span class="more" id="more2">

                <p>Netflix usually wants subscribers glued to their television screens. But this week, the streaming giant will give comedy nerds at least one reason to get off the couch.

                    Netflix Is A Joke: The Festival is the entertainment company’s most ambitious foray into live, in-person events since it was founded 25 years ago: an 11-day, 250-show comedy extravaganza across more than 30 venues in Los Angeles.

                    The festival, scheduled to take place from Thursday to May 8, underscores Netflix’s big-spending commitment to stand-up comedy as an artistic medium and a business venture.

                    In the last decade, the platform has given a home to dozens of exclusive stand-up specials from some of the biggest — and some of the most incendiary — names in modern comedy, luring comics away from HBO and Comedy Central.

                <img src="images/25.jpg" alt="photo one"  onmouseover="changeOpacity(this)"  onmouseout="changeOpacity2(this)"/>
                <p>The lineup at this month’s festival is no less star-studded.

                    Aziz Ansari, Patton Oswalt and Wanda Sykes at the Orpheum Theatre. Kevin Hart at Crypto.com Arena. Gabriel “Fluffy” Iglesias at Dodger Stadium. Sebastian Maniscalco at the Art Deco landmark the Wiltern. John Mulaney at the Hollywood Bowl. Amy Schumer at the trendy Ace Hotel.

                    Robbie Praw, a comedy fanatic who is Netflix's vice president of stand-up and comedy formats, said the coronavirus pandemic forced the company to delay festival plans that were originally mapped out in early 2020.

                    "To have to delay because of the pandemic was really disappointing, but it gave us more time to grow the festival substantially, because we felt like the idea of celebrating stand-up and comedy took on a whole new meaning," Praw said.

                    Praw, who previously spent a dozen years at the esteemed Just for Laughs festival in Montreal, said the array of events now doubles as a "celebration of being in the same room as your friends again."

                    "So many of us in the stand-up community haven't had the opportunity to get together for a big event like this, so it feels like we're about to start a major comedy camp," Praw said.

                    The appearance of “Grace and Frankie” stars Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin at the Hollywood Palladium is a sign that much of the festival is engineered to promote Netflix’s sprawling library of shows and films. In a town that runs on publicity and hype, a veritable takeover of the city could be seen as the ultimate power move.

                    The festival schedule includes events dubbed “Netflix Shows IRL,” including live table reads of Netflix projects like “The Karate Kid” sequel series “Cobra Kai” and the Mindy Kaling-created coming-of-age dramedy “Never Have I Ever” — as well as a screening of the first episode of “The Pentaverate,” Mike Myers’ comeback vehicle.

                    But the most headline-grabbing comic on the festival bill might prove to be Dave Chappelle, the provocative stand-up whose latest Netflix special, “The Closer,” drew accusations of transphobia and plunged the world’s mightiest streaming service into a public relations crisis that dragged on for weeks. He will perform at the Hollywood Bowl for three nights in a row, starting Thursday. <span id="dots4">...</span><span class="more" id="more4">

                <p>WASHINGTON — Democrats are seeking to rekindle major pieces of President Joe Biden’s agenda when Congress returns this week, with high stakes for his legacy, the 2022 midterms and millions of people looking for economic relief.

                    Before the Senate adjourned, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said discussions of a sequel to the failed Build Back Better Act continue and may “pick up pace” after the two-week recess.

                    “We want to get it. Look, there are lots of talks going on right now. They’re not in a great degree of granularity,” he told reporters. “We’d like to move a reconciliation bill and go as far as you can, get as much done as we can, with 50 votes.”

                <p>Manchin has called for a bill with three components: tax reform, prescription drug costs and energy. Higher taxes on corporations and upper earners would produce more revenue, new rules cracking down on prescription drug prices would save the government money, and dollars from both would be split between reducing the deficit and paying for an “all of the above” energy plan that supports climate-focused technology and fossil fuels.

                    All come with question marks, and the further Manchin strays from the House bill that passed last year, the more complicated they might get.

                    Taxes are more complicated, and they could run into thorny issues with Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz. There are many possible versions of prescription drug reform, too; the one in the House bill was carefully crafted to placate her and other holdouts, some from states and districts with heavy ties to the pharmaceutical industry.

                    On energy, Manchin has said he is starting from scratch, but Democrats still assume the rough jumping-off point will be the $555 billion climate plan from the Build Back Better initiative, which included tax credits to encourage faster adoption of renewable energy, zero-emission vehicles and other green tech.

                    If Democrats reach a deal on the above items — a big “if” — the next question is whether Manchin is willing to entertain any additional social spending. Raising revenue similar to the revenue in the House's Build Back Better Act could leave enough to fund one or more programs and still devote an equal amount to deficit reduction.

                    How much does Manchin want a deal?
                    To allies of Schumer, it all comes down to whether Manchin wants to get to “yes” after he pulled out of negotiations entirely in December and withdrew any previous offers he might have made.

                    “In the end, it wasn’t any specific provision or group of provisions that sank the bill. It was that not all 50 Democratic senators were interested in getting to yes,” said Matt House, a former communications director for Schumer. “For it to be successful this time, that’ll have to change.”

                    Even Democrats eager to deal with Manchin on his own terms have publicly wished he would simply write his preferred bill rather than vaguely refer to a possible framework for a deal.

                    Manchin's defenders argue that he has been consistent from the start and that his concerns about ensuring long-term financing for new programs weren’t taken seriously enough by the leadership.

                    This time around, Manchin is widely seen as dictating the terms of any bill from the start, and everyone from the White House to leading progressives appear eager to say yes to whatever he’ll give them. Manchin's decision to walk away from the table in December made it clear he’s fine with no bill. Liberals want it more than he does..  <span id="dots6">...</span><span class="more" id="more6">

                <p>Manchin has called for a bill with three components: tax reform, prescription drug costs and energy. Higher taxes on corporations and upper earners would produce more revenue, new rules cracking down on prescription drug prices would save the government money, and dollars from both would be split between reducing the deficit and paying for an “all of the above” energy plan that supports climate-focused technology and fossil fuels.

                All come with question marks, and the further Manchin strays from the House bill that passed last year, the more complicated they might get.

                Taxes are more complicated, and they could run into thorny issues with Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz. There are many possible versions of prescription drug reform, too; the one in the House bill was carefully crafted to placate her and other holdouts, some from states and districts with heavy ties to the pharmaceutical industry.

                On energy, Manchin has said he is starting from scratch, but Democrats still assume the rough jumping-off point will be the $555 billion climate plan from the Build Back Better initiative, which included tax credits to encourage faster adoption of renewable energy, zero-emission vehicles and other green tech.

                If Democrats reach a deal on the above items — a big “if” — the next question is whether Manchin is willing to entertain any additional social spending. Raising revenue similar to the revenue in the House's Build Back Better Act could leave enough to fund one or more programs and still devote an equal amount to deficit reduction.

                How much does Manchin want a deal?
                To allies of Schumer, it all comes down to whether Manchin wants to get to “yes” after he pulled out of negotiations entirely in December and withdrew any previous offers he might have made.

                “In the end, it wasn’t any specific provision or group of provisions that sank the bill. It was that not all 50 Democratic senators were interested in getting to yes,” said Matt House, a former communications director for Schumer. “For it to be successful this time, that’ll have to change.”

                Even Democrats eager to deal with Manchin on his own terms have publicly wished he would simply write his preferred bill rather than vaguely refer to a possible framework for a deal.

                Manchin's defenders argue that he has been consistent from the start and that his concerns about ensuring long-term financing for new programs weren’t taken seriously enough by the leadership.

                This time around, Manchin is widely seen as dictating the terms of any bill from the start, and everyone from the White House to leading progressives appear eager to say yes to whatever he’ll give them. Manchin's decision to walk away from the table in December made it clear he’s fine with no bill. Liberals want it more than he does. <span id="dots8">...</span><span class="more" id="more8"> the final countdown by sharing their FIFA World Cup 2022™ dreams on social media.

                <p>Perhaps the biggest concern among Democrats eager for a bill is that Manchin and Sinema don’t have compatible demands — mainly on revenue.

                    For Manchin, the priority is to reform the tax code to raise money and cut the deficit. In particular, he wants to raise the corporate tax rate from 21 percent to 25 percent, raise the top capital gains tax rate from 23.8 percent to 28 percent, and close a so-called carried interest loophole that favors hedge funds and other investors.

                    They are all typical Democratic positions. But Sinema isn’t a typical Democrat: She opposed rate increases during negotiations, a position a Sinema aide said she stands by now. Because of her demands, the House passed a bill that still managed to raise about $2 trillion, but through other means, like a new minimum tax on corporations and a surtax on incomes more than $10 million. <span id="dots9">...</span><span class="more" id="more9"> countdown by sharing their FIFA World Cup 2022™ dreams on social media.

                <p>They’re going to have to figure out if all those revenues can stay, if some can stay, or if they have to go back to the drawing board,” said Ben Ritz, the director of the Center for Funding America’s Future at the Progressive Policy Institute.

                    If Manchin and Sinema can’t agree on $2 trillion in taxes and savings, there might be enough overlapping ideas for a $1 trillion bill that could finance a climate plan and deficit reduction. But if Sinema sticks to her red lines and Manchin decides his specific tax ideas are a must-have, the effort could collapse very quickly.

                    Let’s say Sinema and Manchin work it out. Will enough Democrats get on board?
                    A senior House Democratic aide said Schumer needs to recognize he can’t please everybody, advising him to figure out what can win all 50 votes in the caucus and own it. The aide pointed to a remark by former Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid to Time magazine in an article in January when he was asked about Schumer: “If you’re going to be a good leader, you have to be able to say no.”

                    Democrats from the moderate side of the party agree that Schumer’s role will be key.

                    “Because of the divergent views in our caucus, this needs to be a process driven by the White House and Senate majority leader to figure out where the perfect Venn diagram overlap is and maximize what our party can get done,” said John LaBombard, a former spokesman for Sinema. “I believe that if there is a will, there is a way to achieve a package that can earn support from Bernie Sanders and Joe Manchin and everyone in between that would effectively address inflation, rising costs and the cost of living.”

                    On the party’s left flank, progressives have mostly signaled they’re open to a smaller deal, even if it means some painful sacrifices, such as abandoning cherished proposals or even providing a short-term boost to fossil fuels. But the true test would come only if a deal were announced, and a last-minute revolt from just one senator or five House members would kill a bill.

                    Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., said it “makes sense” to consider a bill with taxes, drug savings and climate funding.

                    “I think the really big, key thing we need to consider is what actual financial boosts we’re going to be able to provide to working people. Because people are really feeling the loss of the child tax credit,” she said.

                    Other holdouts have been House moderates demanding a full restoration of the state and local tax deduction, which largely benefits well-off taxpayers and may have to go. But they’d be under enormous party pressure to back a deal with 50 Senate votes.

                    Will the election-year calendar muck it up?
                    Time is short. There are only 12 legislative weeks on the Senate calendar before the monthlong August recess, which is widely seen as the point of no return given the proximity to the election. And Biden's immediate priorities in Congress are a new aid package for Ukraine and Covid-19 funding, a White House official said.

                    To wrap up the larger bill by August, however, a loose framework agreement may be needed much sooner — perhaps as early as the end of May — to give lawmakers time to fill in the details, schedule floor time and vote on amendments.

                    Politically vulnerable Democrats are gearing up for re-election by field-testing their messages. Passing a major piece of legislation late in the cycle could make certain lawmakers feel risk-averse.

                    But others in the party insist that a reconciliation bill would be a net benefit, and many front-line members have expressed strong interest in passing popular initiatives like prescription drug reform to shore up their midterm message. There was little sign of celebration from members in competitive seats when Manchin walked away last year.

                    Sean McElwee, the executive director of the liberal firm Data for Progress, said the political consequences of falling short yet again would be dire. “Failing to pass this bill would further erode our already weak base enthusiasm and set Democrats up for a disaster,” he said. <span id="dots10">...</span><span class="more" id="more10">
