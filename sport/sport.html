                <p>Football does not often provide fairytale finales, but Saturday's Copa del Rey final between Real Betis and Valencia could end with one of the biggest feel-good stories of this or any other season.

                    Betis captain Joaquin, now 40 and one of Spain's most popular personalities, has the chance to crown his career by leading his beloved team to their first trophy in 17 years - with the added spice of the final being played in their home city Seville.

                    This is what makes Joaquin so special. <span id="dots1" class="dots">...</span><span id="more1" class="more">

                    Teen talent to national institution
                    Joaquin is the oldest player in La Liga and a national institution. He has provided more than two decades of entertainment on the pitch since making his debut for Betis, aged 19, in September 2000.

                    A traditional winger with wonderful ball skills, a mesmerising change of pace and wicked delivery into the box, it was immediately obvious he was a special talent.

                    He stayed with his boyhood club Betis for six seasons, winning the Copa del Rey in 2005 and becoming a regular in the Spain team.

                    The winger's consistent brilliance led to a move to Valencia for £20m in 2006. Another Copa del Rey triumph followed two years later, but he gradually became less important for Los Che and joined Malaga in 2011.

                        His spell on the south coast was unexpectedly successful, with Manuel Pellegrini leading an exciting team to a fourth-placed finish and a Champions League quarter-final. Joaquin then left Spain for the first time to spend a couple of seasons with Fiorentina, before making a romantic return to his boyhood club Betis in 2015.</span>

                  <p>Till the time Andre Russell is at the ground, one can be rest assured about the entertainment quotient. It wasn't any different during Kolkata Knight Riders' (KKR) match against Gujarat Titans (GT) in the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2022 in Navi Mumbai on Saturday. The West Indies allrounder performed both with the ball and the bat but could not take his team to victory as KKR failed to chase a 157-run target. It was the two-time champions' fifth loss in eight matches as they find themselves in the bottom half of the table.

                      In the midst of this, Russell shone bright for KKR. <span id="dots10">...</span><span class="more" id="more10">
                          He was brought in the last over with GT on 151/5 in 19 overs. In the next six balls, Russell gave away only five runs and took four wickets. It was the best last over bowling figures in the history of the IPL. His four victims were Abhinav Manohar, Lockie Ferguson, Rahul Tewatia and Yash Dayal. It was also the best bowling figures by any bowler at DY Patil in the IPL. Russell is also now the fourth highest wicket-taker (eight scalps) in the 20th over of an innings in IPL since 2020.</span></p>

                  <p>Till the time Andre Russell is at the ground, one can be rest assured about the entertainment quotient. It wasn't any different during Kolkata Knight Riders' (KKR) match against Gujarat Titans (GT) in the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2022 in Navi Mumbai on Saturday. The West Indies allrounder performed both with the ball and the bat but could not take his team to victory as KKR failed to chase a 157-run target. It was the two-time champions' fifth loss in eight matches as they find themselves in the bottom half of the table.

                      In the midst of this, Russell shone bright for KKR. <span id="dots11">...</span><span class="more" id="more11"> He was brought in the last over with GT on 151/5 in 19 overs. In the next six balls, Russell gave away only five runs and took four wickets. It was the best last over bowling figures in the history of the IPL. His four victims were Abhinav Manohar, Lockie Ferguson, Rahul Tewatia and Yash Dayal. It was also the best bowling figures by any bowler at DY Patil in the IPL. Russell is also now the fourth highest wicket-taker (eight scalps) in the 20th over of an innings in IPL since 2020.</span></p>
