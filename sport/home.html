            <p> <h1>Russian</h1>US diplomats will return to Ukraine, Secretary of State Antony Blinken told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky when the two met in Kyiv on Sunday. The announcement came as Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin became the highest-level US officials to have traveled to the country since the invasion began.
                Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said Russian forces were "continuously attacking" the encircled Azovstal steel plant in the besieged city of Mariupol on Easter Sunday. The site has become one of the last significant holdouts of Ukrainian forces in the city, and is sheltering hundreds of soldiers and civilians.
                Russian forces struck five railway stations in central and western Ukraine on Monday morning as part of a campaign to "systematically destroy railway infrastructure," according to Oleksandr Kamyshin, chairman of Ukrzaliznytsia, Ukraine's state railway company.
                A Ukrainian presidential adviser said Russia was "trying to depopulate the east of Ukraine" amid heavy fighting there. Russia has revealed the goal of its invasion is to take "full control" of southern Ukraine as well as the eastern Donbas region.

                Russian forces continue to target civilian infrastructure in Ukraine, shelling five railway stations on Monday morning as well as causing widespread water and power outages in the eastern Luhansk region.
                Here's the latest on Russia's invasion into Ukraine if you're just joining us:Russia hits railway stations: Russian forces struck five railway stations in central and western Ukraine on Monday morning as part of a campaign to "systematically destroy railway infrastructure," according to Oleksandr Kamyshin, chairman of Ukrzaliznytsia, Ukraine's state railway company.
                Luhansk suffers water and power outages: Heavy Russian shelling means "almost the entire Luhansk region is without water supply," said Serhiy Hayday, head of the regional military administration, adding that 30,000 families were without electricity.
                Russian progress limited: Russian forces have made only "minor advances" since shifting their focus to taking control over the eastern Donbas region of Ukraine, the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) said Monday. "Without sufficient logistical and combat support enablers in place, Russia has yet to achieve a significant breakthrough," said the MoD on Twitter.
                US visit: US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv on Sunday, making them the highest-level US officials to have traveled to the country since the Russian invasion began. Blinken said during the meeting that US diplomats would return to Ukraine this week.
                Mariupol under attack: Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said Russian forces were "continuously attacking" the encircled Azovstal steel plant in the besieged city of Mariupol on Orthodox Easter Sunday. Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed earlier this week that Russia forces had achieved the "liberation" of Mariupol, but ordered his forces to stop short of taking the Azovstal plant, the last major bastion of Ukrainian defense in the city.
                Kherson: The military head of the south-central city of Kryvyi Rih said Sunday that Ukraine had observed preparations for a possible offensive by Russian forces from the Kherson region, adding defenses were being bolstered in the area. In televised remarks, Oleksandr Vilkul said Russian forces were "forming an offensive strike formation in our direction in the Kherson region." Vilkul said the Kryvyi Rih garrison was in a state of readiness and had defenses prepared.
                UN visit: UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres “will be received by President Vladimir Putin” on Tuesday in Moscow, after having a working meeting and lunch with the foreign minister of Russia, the UN said. He is also expected to meet Zelensky on Thursday in Ukraine, according to a UN spokesperson.
                Russia's onslaught: An adviser to Zelensky's administration said Sunday that Russia was "trying to depopulate the east of Ukraine," amid heavy fighting there. Earlier this week, Russia revealed that the goal of its invasion of Ukraine is to take "full control" over southern Ukraine as well as the eastern Donbas region, which has been the front line of the country's conflict with Russia since 2014..</span>

            <p><h1>Football</h1>
                Football does not often provide fairytale finales, but Saturday's Copa del Rey final between Real Betis and Valencia could end with one of the biggest feel-good stories of this or any other season.
                Betis captain Joaquin, now 40 and one of Spain's most popular personalities, has the chance to crown his career by leading his beloved team to their first trophy in 17 years - with the added spice of the final being played in their home city Seville.
                This is what makes Joaquin so special. <span id="dots2">...</span><span class="more" id="more2">Teen talent to national institution
                Joaquin is the oldest player in La Liga and a national institution. He has provided more than two decades of entertainment on the pitch since making his debut for Betis, aged 19, in September 2000.
                 A traditional winger with wonderful ball skills, a mesmerising change of pace and wicked delivery into the box, it was immediately obvious he was a special talent.
                 He stayed with his boyhood club Betis for six seasons, winning the Copa del Rey in 2005 and becoming a regular in the Spain team.
                 The winger's consistent brilliance led to a move to Valencia for £20m in 2006. Another Copa del Rey triumph followed two years later, but he gradually became less important for Los Che and joined Malaga in 2011.
                  His spell on the south coast was unexpectedly successful, with Manuel Pellegrini leading an exciting team to a fourth-placed finish and a Champions League quarter-final. Joaquin then left Spain for the first time to spend a couple of seasons with Fiorentina, before making a romantic return to his boyhood club Betis in 2015.</span></p>

            <p><h1>Breaking bad</h1>Breaking bad news is one of a physician's most difficult duties, yet medical education typically offers little formal preparation for this daunting task. Without proper training, the discomfort and uncertainty associated with breaking bad news may lead physicians to emotionally disengage from patients. Numerous study results show that patients generally desire frank and empathetic disclosure of a terminal diagnosis or other bad news. Focused training in communication skills and techniques to facilitate breaking bad news has been demonstrated to improve patient satisfaction and physician comfort. Physicians can build on the following simple mnemonic, ABCDE, to provide hope and healing to patients receiving bad news: Advance preparation—arrange adequate time and privacy, confirm medical facts, review relevant clinical data, and emotionally prepare for the encounter. Building a therapeutic relationship—identify patient preferences regarding the disclosure of bad news. Communicating well—determine the patient's knowledge and understanding of the situation, proceed at the patient's pace, avoid medical jargon or euphemisms, allow for silence and tears, and answer questions. Dealing with patient and family reactions—assess and respond to emotional reactions and empathize with the patient. Encouraging/validating emotions—offer realistic hope based on the patient's goals and deal with your own needs.. <span id="dots4">...</span><span class="more" id="more4">
                Breaking bad news to patients is one of the most difficult responsibilities in the practice of medicine. Although virtually all physicians in clinical practice encounter situations entailing bad news, medical school offers little formal training in how to discuss bad news with patients and their families. This article presents an overview of issues pertaining to breaking bad news and practical recommendations for clinicians wishing to improve their clinical skills in this area.

What Is Bad News?
One source1 defines bad news as “any news that drastically and negatively alters the patient's view of her or his future.” Professional bicyclist Lance Armstrong's recollection of being diagnosed with metastatic testicular cancer exemplifies the impact of bad news on one's self-image: “I left my house on October 2, 1996, as one person and came home another.”2 Bad news is stereotypically associated with a terminal diagnosis, but family physicians encounter many situations that involve imparting bad news; for example, a pregnant woman's ultrasound verifies a fetal demise, a middle-aged woman's magnetic resonance imaging scan confirms the clinical suspicion of multiple sclerosis, or an adolescent's polydipsia and weight loss prove to be the onset of diabetes.

How a patient responds to bad news can be influenced by the patient's psychosocial context. It might simply be a diagnosis that comes at an inopportune time, such as unstable angina requiring angioplasty during the week of a daughter's wedding, or it may be a diagnosis that is incompatible with one's employment, such as a coarse tremor developing in a cardiovascular surgeon. When the physician cares for multiple members of a family, the lines between the patient's needs and the family's needs may become blurred. Most family physicians have faced a conference room full of family members awaiting news about the patient, or have been pulled aside for a hallway discussion with the request to withhold the conversation from the patient or other family members.

Why Is Breaking Bad News So Difficult?
There are many reasons why physicians have difficulty breaking bad news. A common concern is how the news will affect the patient, and this is often used to justify withholding bad news. Hippocrates advised “concealing most things from the patient while you are attending to him. Give necessary orders with cheerfulness and serenity…revealing nothing of the patient's future or present condition. For many patients…have taken a turn for the worse…by forecast of what is to come.”3

In 1847, the American Medical Association's first code of medical ethics stated, “The life of a sick person can be shortened not only by the acts, but also by the words or the manner of a physician. It is, therefore, a sacred duty to guard himself carefully in this respect, and to avoid all things which have a tendency to discourage the patient and to depress his spirits.”

In the past few decades, traditional paternalistic models of patient care have given way to an emphasis on patient autonomy and empowerment. A review of studies on patient preferences regarding disclosure of a terminal diagnosis found that 50 to 90 percent of patients desired full disclosure.4 Because a sizable minority of patients still may not want full disclosure, the physician needs to ascertain how the patient would like to have bad news addressed. Qualitative studies about the information needs of cancer patients identify several consistent themes, but which theme is most important to any given patient is highly variable and few patient characteristics accurately predict which theme will be most important.5 Therefore, the physician faces the challenge of individualizing the manner of breaking bad news and the content delivered, according to the patient's desires or needs.

Physicians also have their own issues about breaking bad news. It is an unpleasant task. Physicians do not wish to take hope away from the patient. They may be fearful of the patient's or family's reaction to the news, or uncertain how to deal with an intense emotional response. Bad news often must be delivered in settings that are not conducive to such intimate conversations. The hectic pace of clinical practice may force a physician to deliver bad news with little forewarning or when other responsibilities are competing for the physician's attention.

Historically, the emphasis on the biomedical model in medical training places more value on technical proficiency than on communication skills. Therefore, physicians may feel unprepared for the intensity of breaking bad news, or they may unjustifiably feel that they have failed the patient. The cumulative effect of these factors is physician uncertainty and discomfort, and a resultant tendency to disengage from situations in which they are called on to break bad news.6 Rabow and McPhee keenly describe the end result, “Clinicians focus often on relieving patients' bodily pain, less often on their emotional distress, and seldom on their suffering.”7

Several professional groups have published consensus guidelines on how to discuss bad news; however, few of those guidelines are evidence-based.8 The clinical efficacy of many standard recommendations has not been empirically demonstrated.9,10 Less than 25 percent of publications on breaking bad news are based on studies reporting original data, and those studies commonly have methodologic limitations.

Learning general communication skills can enable physicians to break bad news in a manner that is less uncomfortable for them and more satisfying for patients and their families.11 Numerous investigators have demonstrated that focused educational interventions improve student and resident skills in delivering bad news.12–14 Following traumatic deaths, surviving family members judged the most important features of delivering bad news to be the attitude of the person who gave the news, the clarity of the message, privacy, and the newsgiver's ability to answer questions.15 As Franks observes, “It is not an isolated skill but a particular form of communication.”16</span></p>
